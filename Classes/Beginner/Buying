Practice buying cryptocurrency on your own.

Success criteria:
You are purchasing cryptocurrency on your own outside of class without further help.

For most people buying on their own means opening and account at an exchange of your choice. It typically requires using real name, linking to bank or debit card, uploading scans of your state id or passport, and a 0 to 10 day waiting period. You can buy as little as $1 with a $1 fee, $100+ with a 3% fee, or anything in between. We will discuss researching large, reputable, quality, and legal exchanges that we can trust. We'll also try buying a tiny amount at first to test the waters.

We'll also talk about how we might buy "over the counter" without an exchange. To do that on your own may involve meeting a stranger with cash or having a friend willing to sell. I've never bought that way, but I think its a good topic for discussion.
